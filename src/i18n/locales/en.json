  "aboutP2": "I found myself filming little videos just for him. Not for social media. Not for likes. For the day he turns 15… 18… 30. I wanted him to know who I really was, how I laughed, what I believed, what mattered to me.",
  "aboutP3": "But these pieces of my life and his were scattered everywhere. On phones. Clouds. Old drives. Nothing felt lasting. Nothing felt safe. So I built lifeli.me.",
