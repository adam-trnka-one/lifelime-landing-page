  "aboutP1": "I grew up with my mom and grandma, trying to piece together who I was from stories, photos in boxes. I'm a father now and everything changed when my son was born.",
  "aboutP2": "I found myself filming little videos just for him. Not for social media. Not for likes. For the day he turns 15… 18… 30. I wanted him to know who I really was, how I laughed, what I believed, what mattered to me.",
  "aboutP3": "But these pieces of my life and his were scattered everywhere. On phones. Clouds. Old drives. Nothing felt lasting. Nothing felt safe. So I built lifeli.me.",
  "aboutP4": "lifeli.me is my answer to a simple but powerful question:",
  "aboutP4b": "What do we leave behind - and will it still matter 30... 50... 100... years from now?",
  "aboutP5": "It's a place to craft your legacy, one memory at a time. It's built for families—for the quiet, important moments. Births. First steps. Last hugs.",
  "aboutP6": "Photos, videos, letters to your future self. Milestones. Your treasures. All organized, preserved, and portable for decades—like a Svalbard Global Seed Vault, only for your memories.",
  "aboutP7": "This isn't about going viral. It's about being remembered for who you are and remembering who we are.",
  "aboutP8": "I believe every person deserves a place to hold their story. Not just for today, but for generations to come.",
  "aboutP9": "That's why I'm building lifeli.me. Not as a product. But as a promise.",
